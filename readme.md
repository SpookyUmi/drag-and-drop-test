I tested different implementations of the [DND-kit](https://docs.dndkit.com/) library. To do the nesting as we want it, it's a bit more complicated. I used this [Codepen](https://codesandbox.io/s/dnd-kit-tree-forked-tudlm5?file=/src/App.js) to have something as close as what we want.

Useful links I used to test different implementations with DND-kit:
- [dnd-kit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit)
- [Basic implementation](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/say-goodbye-to-react-dnd-hello-to-dnd-kit-the-future-of-drag-and-drop-is-here-6aa488f17a0)

- [dnd-kit nested containers](https://codesandbox.io/s/kvdgn?file=/src/app.js)
